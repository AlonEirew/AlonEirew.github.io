Recently, I’ve been introduced to a huge industry that I was previously unaware of — The Print-on-Demand (PoD) industry, and the story behind its growth serves as a compelling testament to human ingenuity and the transformative power of technology.

In case you lived under a rock like myself, PoD involves the process of imprinting various designs, including drawings, paintings, sketches, logos, and inspirational quotes, onto a wide range of accessories such as shirts, mugs, hats, and more. What was once a practice employed by small local stores creating personalized mugs for special occasions has now evolved into a thriving $6.2B industry in 2022, and an expected $40B by 2030, entitled as ‘Print-on-Demand’.

PoD, as a concept, has been around since the 1950’s. However, in the past decade or so, it has experienced a remarkable transformation thanks to industrialization, automation, robotics, online stores and AI which helped transform this once a niche into a huge industry.

Imagine you’re an artist dreaming about starting your own business centered around shirts carrying your unique designs. In the past, this required specialized equipment and resources, which probably prevented you from pursuing your dream. However today, online platforms such as printify.com, modalyst.co, printful.com to name just a few, empower individuals to design and print their creations onto a range of accessories, without worrying about printing equipment, storing, shipping, and displaying their created merchandise for sale. This democratization of PoD has not only opened doors for entrepreneurs but also established itself as one of the most lucrative passive-income avenues, particularly for individuals with exceptional design capabilities.

To accomplish this, the PoD manufacturing business heavily relied on the progress made in previous technologies, including clothes manufacturing machine, industrial printers, efficient packaging and shipping solutions, designer tools, rich web and UI frameworks and more. Furthermore, the industry was propelled forward by integrating with e-commerce giants like Amazon, eBay, Shopify and Etsy, providing a platform for PoD businesses to reach customers almost anywhere in the world.

More recently, the PoD industry has experienced yet another groundbreaking transformation due to recent advancements with the introduction of AI tools like DALLE-E and Midjourney, rendering the creation of beautiful designs no longer exclusive to a select few with exceptional talent and graphic design expertise. Now, the ability to craft visually stunning designs (in seconds) is in the reach for anyone.

This remarkable accessibility and the enticing profit potential have ignited a surge of individuals eager to have a piece of the PoD pie. But before you get excited and run to open your own PoD business, those changes have also resulted in the PoD market reaching a saturation point. This poses a challenge for newcomers to generate profits without implementing effective marketing strategies and presenting an impressive portfolio of designs.

The PoD use-case provides insights into the evolving landscape of this product and the potential for similar transformations in other products. Previously, printing on shirts and accessories was primarily confined to small businesses operating in a niche market. However, today, PoD has developed into a vast worldwide industry of makers, creators and buyers, supported by an array of advanced technologies. Notably, PoD shirts have undergone a remarkable transformation. Once dismissed as cheap and unfashionable, they have now emerged as a stylish alternative to expensive fashion designer clothes.

We can use this to envision a future where technology advances will continue to accumulate and unlock boundless opportunities. Two notable technologies yet to reach their full potential but capable of revolutionizing product manufacturing by the masses, are 3D printers and AI-enhanced 3D modeling tools. These technologies have the potential to enable the custom design and manufacturing of popular products, including toys, sports accessories, home decor items, kitchen utilities, jewelry, and more, making them accessible through the Print-on-Demand model.
