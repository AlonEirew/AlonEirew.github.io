My core expertise includes **information extraction, semantic search, data mining**, and working with **large language models (LLMs)**.

Previously, I led **NLP research at Intel Labs**, where I collaborated with academic partners, developed large-scale AI models, and advised startups through the **Intel Ignite accelerator**.
